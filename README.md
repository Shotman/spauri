This may mostly be useless since the Spotify Developer Terms forbid the use of their API for the purposes of creating derivative works, idk what they mean by "derivative", does it mean making a new service that uses spotify in the background? Or just different spotify clients?

Im going to need to do this the `H A C C E R M A N` way by using the private API because I'm cringe enough to care about laws (ish).

**This is will only every work for Spotify Premium accounts due to technical limitations, if any proposed changes contain code that adds the use of:**

- **Free Accounts**
- **Advertising**
- **Limited Skips**

**The Pull Request / Proposal WILL be immediately denied.**

**Mainly to keep me out of legal trouble.**
